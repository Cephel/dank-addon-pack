Its possible to make Bagnon read data from other sources.

To do this, you'll need to:
* Create a new addon, and copy the database folder (including ui.lua and xml) from Bagnon_Forever
* Modify ALL the functions in database\database.lua to read from whatever addon's data.
	I've put all non BagnonDB functions in a seperate file for clarity, but its not absolutely necessary.
* Make sure you've listed Bagnon_Core and whatever addon you're reading data from as dependencies.
