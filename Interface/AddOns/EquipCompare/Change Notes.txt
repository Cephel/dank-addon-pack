* New Developers API introduced! You can now request your favourite AddOns' authors to add support for EquipCompare easily.
* New option: shift tooltips upwards if they are taller than the game tooltip.
* Crossbows and Thrown weapons now work in English and French version. (German will be added later).
* Some more garbage collection improvements (by Sarf).
* The default Blizzard ShoppingTooltips are now completely replaced by EquipCompare's ones even at vendors and the auction house too. This means that EquipCompare's configuration options will take affect there too.

* Revamped localization files, now divided into several files (by sarf)

Changes in 2.6.3:

Changes in 2.6.2:
* German localization (thanks Maischter!)
* Fixed an issue with the width of the "Currently Equipped" label. Now it doesn't hang outside the tooltip window any more. (In this process I learnt a lot about how tooltips lay out their contents, which must be useful.)
* Added a version ID in various places in the UI, so you can tell which version of EquipCompare you are running. Can you find all of the places?

Changes in 2.6.1:
* French localization (thanks beWRage!)
* Minor change to localization mechanism
* Fixed a minor bug in tooltip placement scheme, which was due to a Typo in a T. GameToolTip does not equal GameTooltip. This was causing comparison tooltips to sometimes appear on unpreferred side. (Although this would never cause them to be off the screen).
* EquipCompare.nopatch folder now included to stop Cosmos from deleting EquipCompare.

Changes in 2.6:
* This version has some major internal code overhauls, hence the big jump in version number. It is about half-way to version 3.0, which will contain all the internal overhauls I have planned. There are many purposes to these overhauls, including the reduction/elimination of potential sources of conflict with other AddOns and performance improvements. For the more advanced users out there: this version now uses its own ComparisonTooltips, rather than relying on the Blizzard UI's ShoppingTooltips.
* Added little labels on the comparison tooltips, saying "Currently Equipped". Fixed the formatting of the lines in the comparison tooltips.
* Two-handed items now display comparisons with both Main and Off hand item.
* Slight change in tooltip placement policy: Main Hand tooltip is now always on the left of Off Hand tooltip, whether the comparison tooltips are to the left or to the right.
* Fixed the issue with Item links, which was causing the comparison tooltips to disappear when the main game tooltip faded out or got hidden.
* CharactersViewer-based comparisons are now shown in the character frame as well. This means you can select an alt in CharactersViewer and hover over your inventory to get instant comparison.
* *Experimental* Control key mode: Get comparison tooltips only when holding the Control key. Type "/eqc control" to turn it on, or use Cosmos configuration menu. Warning! This mode is experimental at the moment, it may contain bugs. Use it at your own risk.

Changes in 2.1.1:
- Fixed a bug introduced with the new tooltip layout scheme in version 2.1, that caused the 2nd comparison tooltip to not appear. Sorry, this one slipped by me in testing.
- Whilst at it, made two-handed weapons show the off-hand slot as well.

Changes in 2.1:
- Reviewed comparison tooltip placement behaviour. It should be much better at placing tooltips in sensible places.
- Fixed a bug when used together with Charactersviewer. Comparison tooltips at merchants and at the auction house really do show your alt's equipment now. 

Changes in 2.0.2:
- Enchanced the interaction with CharactersViewer some more. Now you get the comparison tooltips at Merchants and Auction Houses overriden according to your CV selection.

Changes in 2.0.1:
- Temporary work-around for the incompatibility issues many user have been experiencing with other AddOns.
- Occasional error message when mousing over some items:
"attempt to perform arithmetic on local `left' (a nil value)"
should be fixed now.
- Items that are both Soulbound and Unique should receive comparison tips now.
- Included special support for Flisher's CharactersViewer. See the Optional Dependencies for explanation. Note: this feature hasn't been tested exhaustively yet and may not work as intended.
