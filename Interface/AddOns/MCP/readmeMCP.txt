MCP - Master Control Program aka ACP - Addon Control Panel

MCP allows enabling/disabling addons in game without logging out.
Built in profiles allow to quickly switch addon sets.

Slash Commands:

/mcp 
- to open the panel (or choose new Addons option in game menu)

/mcp profileName 
- to quickly load profile be aware that non existing profile will return error and Ive no time for fancy idiot proof scripts 
so THINK before you type. It is case sensitive. It could bug if used in combat (tests didnt show it but there is possibility).

/mcp notSavedProfileName
- to return error so dont do it DOE !

Current Developer:
Dym aka Basara of Emerald Dream

Beta testing:
