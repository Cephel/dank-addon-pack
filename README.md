# Dank Addon Pack
> An exercise in advanced autism

-Anonymous

This addon pack is designed with a perfectionist approach. If there is not a clear purpose for an addon, it shouldn't be there. It is designed class-agnostic, meaning it should work on every class seamlessly. The placement of addons and other UI elements is meticulously aligned by manually editing the config files to be pixel perfect to please the ~~autistic~~ aesthetic gentleman of tomorrow.


## Download
The recommended way to download the addon pack is through git:
```
git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/Cephel/dank-addon-pack.git
```
You can either clone into an empty folder and copy the contents into the appropriate folder in your WoW installation, or directly clone into the WoW installation itself.

### Important
The .zip download **does not include many of the addons**. If you choose to download through the .zip method, you must download all the addons listed under [Manual download required](#manual-download-required) yourself.


## Installation
- Extract to your WoW directory
- Rename `WTF/Account/ACCOUNT_NAME_IN_CAPS` to your account name in caps
  - You can copy this folder multiple times for multiple accounts
- Rename `WTF/Account/ACCOUNT_NAME_IN_CAPS/Realm_Name` to the name of the realm
- Rename `WTF/Account/ACCOUNT_NAME_IN_CAPS/Realm_Name/Character_Name` to your character name
  - You can copy this folder multiple times for multiple characters

Optional: You can skip this entire step if you want to set up the addons yourself.


## Update
The following command updates everything in place:
```
git pull && git submodule update --checkout
```
