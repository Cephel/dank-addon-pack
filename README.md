# Dank Addon Pack
> An exercise in advanced autism

-Anonymous

This addon pack is designed with a minimalist approach. If there is not a clear purpose for an addon, it shouldn't be there. It is designed class-agnostic, meaning it should work on every class, so no special x-class-exclusive addons are included. The placement of addons and other UI elements is meticiously aligned by manually editing the config files for pixel perfect alignment to please the ~~autistic~~ aesthetic gentleman of tomorrow.
