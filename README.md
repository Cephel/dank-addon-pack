# Dank Addon Pack
> An exercise in advanced autism

-Anonymous

This addon pack is designed with a minimalist approach. If there is not a clear purpose for an addon, it shouldn't be there. It is designed class-agnostic, meaning it should work on every class, so no special x-class-exclusive addons are included. The placement of addons and other UI elements is meticiously aligned by manually editing the config files for pixel perfect alignment to please the ~~autistic~~ aesthetic gentleman of tomorrow.

# Installation
- Extract to your WoW directory
- Rename `WTF/Account/ACCOUNT_NAME_IN_CAPS` to your account name in caps
  - You can copy this folder multiple times for multiple accounts
- Rename `WTF/Account/ACCOUNT_NAME_IN_CAPS/Realm_Name` to the name of the realm
- Rename `WTF/Account/ACCOUNT_NAME_IN_CAPS/Realm_Name/Character_Name` to your character name
  - You can copy this folder multiple times for multiple characters

## Important
The .zip download does not currently include any of the addons listed under "Credits" below, this is the fault of Github, not mine. Please download them manually right now while I work on a solution.
